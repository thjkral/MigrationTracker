# MigrationTracker
By using data from the GBIF platform, the goal of this project is to map and
visualize migratory pattern of birds. This will be an ongoing project on 
which I see myself expanding to train programming skills. I will start with 
looking at one or several (endangered) species and try to discern patterns. 
Maybe I will expand into Machine Learning territory by adding different data 
sets.
